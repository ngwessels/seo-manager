## NextJS SEO Manager

This is a SEO project currently in development for NextJS, Gatsby and other React SSR (Server Side Rendering) Frameworks. Currently this project is being developed and not ready for public use. To stay up-to-date on updates sign up on our [Website](https://www.seomanager.dev).

## What is the Goal?

The eventual goal is to tie in page SEO, structured data (advanced SEO), a file management system, dynamically generated sitemaps and robots.txt into one project that is all under a few lines of code. Changing a title tag or page meta tags should not require a project rebuild, it should be done in almost real-time. Plus being able to make those changes on your own website, not a third party can be useful.
