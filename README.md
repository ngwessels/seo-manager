## About

The nextjs-seo-manager is a tool for your NextJS website that allows you to setup an Optimized website quickly and effortlessly. This tool is useful for projects that do not want to constantly rebuild their project bundle to update the page's SEO, or your projects robots.txt and/or sitemaps.
